To create a framework  focused on how learners can use feedback to adjust their learning strategies. feedback needs to be used effectively to be centred on learning

#### Annotations


In particular, there has been a shift away from an exclusive focus on what teachers do to initiate feedback (inputs), to what students do and how they might be more actively involved in feedback processes (Boud and Molloy 2013).
