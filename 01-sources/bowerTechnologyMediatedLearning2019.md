While technology-enhanced learning can appear on the surface to be quite a simplistic phenomenon, in reality, it is deceptively complex, with its various actors, their diverse assumptions, intentions, and background knowledge, the numerous technologies at peoples’ disposal and their various attributes, all within the context of attempting to facilitate learning. 

 

The use of digital technologies such as wikis, blogs, social media, mobile applications, virtual worlds, learning management systems and so on is becoming increasingly common in formal learning environments, particularly within online learning environments such as massive open online courses (MOOCs), and in many of these instances technology is the means by which interactions between participants (most typically teachers and students) is mediated. 

 

A wide variety of theoretical perspectives have been used to examine the use of technology in education, including Activity Theory, Social-Cognitive Theory, affordances, multimodal and multimedia learning, 

 

Actor Network Theory, Community of Inquiry and Communities of Practice, to name a few. However, some of these have been borrowed from fields outside technology-enhanced learning so as to lack contextual specificity, while others focus attention on specific aspects of technology-enhanced learning at the expense of additional important influences. In this paper, pertinent theories and perspectives of import are synthesised to derive a holistic view of how learning occurs in situations where technology mediates learning. 

 

The term “mediated” can have several meanings, and in this paper the term “technology-mediated learning” is used to imply that technology is the means by which information is conveyed and people are linked together. 

 

While Carse (1986) points out that in an ideal world the technology would be so transparent that users do not notice it is there, in reality the technologies, their features, and the way in which they are used, do have a substantial influence on activity and learning, and thus is it important the technology-enhanced learning field has a domain-specific and comprehensive means of analysing their educational use. 

 

The fundamental assumption of technology-mediated learning The examination presented herein is based on the fundamental assumption that, in a technology-enhanced learning context, technologies in and of themselves have no intentions, but rather are featured objects used to convey meaning between participants. This can be formally expressed as follows. Fundamental assumption of technology-mediated learning: In technology-mediated learning contexts, agentic intentions reside with humans, and not with technology 

 

That is to say, it is people, often educators and learners, who control the content that is represented and shared using technology, with the operations and representations of the technology being a consequence of the actions of humans. 

 

in most cases for the purposes of educational technology analysis, educators and researchers may choose to consider technology as what Latour calls an “intermediary,” ie, that transports meaning across a network without manipulation or transformation. 

 

Technologies can have agency—they may affect change in educational settings—but they are intentionally designed by humans to do so, and do not inherently act with intentions. This is the position adopted elsewhere in the technology-enhanced learning field (Fox, 2002; Goodyear & Carvalho, 2014a). For this reason, the term “intentional agency” is used in the fundamental assumption above, to clarify that the agency we are talking about is purposeful and emerges from participants. 

 

It is particularly important, at least from an epistemological perspective, to make the fundamental assumption of technology-mediated learning explicit, because it places responsibility for technology-mediated learning decisions entirely with people (most notably, teachers and students). Though the assumption that humans rather than technology have intentionality may be questioned in an age of increasingly powerful artificial intelligence, it is conjectured that it safely applies in the large majority of educational settings where educators are using technology to mediate the learning of their students. The bounds of this assumption, including in our age of rapidly evolving artificial intelligence, are further considered in the Discussion section of this paper. 

 

Premise 1: Digital technologies can perform a mediating role for participants in their attempts to achieve learning goals 

 

Premise 2: In technology-mediated learning contexts, participant beliefs, knowledge, practices and the environment all mutually influence one another 

 

From a sociopolitical perspective, environmental factors such as government policy, industry organisations, societal concerns, professional bodies and financial tensions within education sectors influence educational beliefs and practices by prescribing and constraining ways in which technology should be used for learning (Selwyn, 2007; Veletsianos & Moe, 2017). 

 

Premise 3: In technology-mediated learning settings, the role of teachers is to help optimise student learning outcomes and experiences through the purposeful deployment of learning technologies 

 

An important recent development is the increasing emphasis upon how feedback from students, including learning analytics data, can and should inform designing for learning in contexts where technology mediates learning (Lockyer, Heathcote, & Dawson, 2013). This accords with a shift from teachers simply being deliverers of static content to teachers as orchestrating a number of complex technology-enhanced design, evaluation and implementation roles (Roschelle, Dimitriadis, & Hoppe, 2013). 

 

Premise 4: The affordances of technologies, including their recognition and use, influences the sorts of representation, interaction, production and learning that can take place 

 

If technologies mediate learning, then the action potentials or “affordances” of the technologies being used must influence the learning that can take place. Gibson (1979) defined the affordances of an object as “what it offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes” (p. 127, italics by Gibson). 

 

For instance, affordances have been classified into clusters such as those relating to media, spatial, temporal, navigational, emphasis, synthesis and access control elements, noting that more static affordances facilitate more receptive learning, while more interactive affordances promote more productive learning (Bower, 2008). 

 

As well as all of these affordances that provide functional options to users, there are a range of non-functional affordances such as those relating to reliability, aesthetics, usability and technical performance that can influence learning, for example by affecting the fidelity with which interactions between participants are mediated (Bower, 2008). 

 

Synchronicity is another important aspect of learning technologies, with asynchronous technologies such as wikis and discussion forums offering more opportunities for reflective contribution compared to synchronous technologies such web conferencing or virtual world environments that enable real-time rich media i n t e r a c t i v i t y. 

 

Given people have agentic intention, not technologies, it is important for educators and often students to select and appropriate technologies that will help to best facilitate the representation, interaction and productive requirements of the intended learning tasks. 

 

Premise 5: The way in which modalities are used and combined influences the way in which meaning is processed, interpreted, created and interrelated 

 

When learning is being mediated using technology, all communication occurs as a combination of one or more modalities. Modalities are the representational (semiotic) resources that are used to make meaning, such as images, sound, text and video (from Jewitt, 2006). The way in which modalities are used and combined is important because of its direct impact on how accurately and efficiently people interpret communications to create and internalise meaning (Kress, Jewitt, Ogborn, & Tsatsarelis, 2001). 

 

At the heart of these results is the fact that people have limited information processing capacity, and when combinations of modalities cause them to reach a state of “cognitive overload” they can no longer sufficiently interrelate information for learning to occur (Paas & Sweller, 2014). 

 

Premise 6: The way in which technology is used to mediate interaction patterns and possibilities between networks of participants influences the learning that takes place 

 

One of the principle ways that technology can mediate learning is through learning networks, which in a digital context can be defined as collections of people and devices interconnected via technologies that are engaging in and supporting the completion of learning tasks (in accordance with Goodyear & Carvalho, 2014b). 

 

In Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, the way in which technology is used plays a substantial role in shaping collaboration, however, the effectiveness of learning is also heavily influenced by the way educators design tasks, support groupwork processes, provide scaffolding and guide the overall learning experience (Goodyear, Jones, & Thompson, 2014). 

 

The mutually influential role of the teacher and technologies in mediating different online learning patterns is highlighted by Laurillard’s (2002) Conversational Framework, noting that the theorisation presented herein constitutes a generalisation of the types of learning processes that can take place and the technologies that can be used. 

 

Premise 7: Arrangements of technologies and the way they are used can influence the sense of presence and community that are experienced 

 

When learning is being mediated using technology, all sense of presence and community must be established through those technologies and the way they are used. According to the Community of Inquiry model, students’ sense of presence is related to their sense of connection with the content being studied, the teacher and their peers (Garrison, Anderson, & Archer, 2010). If students do not feel confident with the mediating technologies they are using, and do not feel a strong sense of teacher contribution, cognitive engagement or social connection, it can result in a sense of “transactional distance” (Moore, 2013). On the other hand, when technology is used well, it can result in the development of “Communities of Practice” (Wenger, McDermott, & Snyder, 2002), where learners and teachers mutually engage, jointly enterprise and share their repertoires within and beyond a course. 

 

Essential aspects of the theorisations above are captured in Figure 1. In particular, in technology-mediated learning the technologies are positioned as mediators between participants (Premise 1), beliefs, knowledge and practices feature as explicit influences within the broader environment (Premise 2), the role of the teacher is to optimise design and implementation of learning tasks based on learner feedback (Premise 3), identification and effectively utilisation of technology affordances is critical (Premise 4), the way in which modalities are used and combined will influence information processing of students (Premise 5), interaction and production through technology-mediated networks impacts upon learning processes (Premise 6), and the way in which the mediating technologies are used can influence the sense of presence and community that is experienced within the environment (Premise 7). 

 

The educator and learner background knowledge and beliefs determine what is communicated—according to technology-mediated learning theory the technology has no ultimate intentional agency. The contributions of students, through their technology-mediated interaction and production, play a critical role in providing feedback to the teacher that can inform subsequent pedagogical actions. The environment, while inextricably interconnected with the beliefs, knowledge and practices of the participants, is positioned as circumscriptive, indicating its overarching contextual role in influencing learning processes, presence and community. 

 

The technology-mediated learning theorisations above are commensurate with other broader learning theories, eg, behaviourist, cognitivist, constructivist, social-constructivist or connectivist perspectives. All of the assumptions and conceptions that apply for other theories can still be brought to bear when using technology-mediated learning theory, noting that technology-mediated learning theory may provide a useful lens for examining the role of technology in the learning process when these different learning theories are being applied. 

 

For instance, when analysing the cognitive and affective impact of a form of written instructions in class, the fact that the instructions are on a computer screen rather than on paper may not be of any analytical consequence. In such cases, technology-mediated learning theory may not add value, because the way in which technology is being used to facilitate learning and the role that technology plays is not of central importance. 

 

Does technology-mediated learning theory apply to situations where the technology itself is the focus of study in a face-to-face classroom, eg, when a child or adult is learning to program a robot? In these situations, it could be argued that the technology is in fact mediating learning, and is being intentionally used by educators to achieve student outcomes. However, in these instances, the technology is less directly being used as a means of conveying messages and linking people, so technology-mediated learning theory is less likely to be applicable and useful. 

 

The fundamental assumption of the technology-mediated learning theory presented above is that technology is the means by which intentions of human participants are mediated, rather than possessing any intentions in and of itself. The claim that humans have agentic intentions, and that technologies do not, has philosophical roots that date back to Searle (1980), who argues that artificial intelligence does not have intentionality unless it has been programmed with causal powers that in sum resemble those of the human mind. However, in an age of rapidly advancing artificial intelligence, this assumption and the bounds of its applicability may be called into question. For instance, if an online learning system marks student assignments and provides them with feedback, or makes decisions about student learning pathways, without any additional human input, is technology still a mediator of learning or has it become an intentioned actor? On the one hand, a human or humans have at some point programmed the system to provide intelligent feedback and make intelligent pedagogical decisions, so in fact, the technology is still executing the will of humans, albeit in a less deterministic fashion. On the other hand, as artificial intelligence technologies become more autonomous, and the relationship between the underlying intentions of the human programmer and the actions of technology becomes less direct, it may be argued that technology is no longer a mediator but exercises independent intentional acts. In such instances, researchers and educators may choose to separate those aspects of the technology that are used for mediation, and those components which are treated as intentioned actors. This point is seen as a possible area for vibrant and ongoing future debate. 

 

It should also be noted that the integrated theorisation presented above in no way provides solutions for how technology should be used to successfully mediate learning. Rather it provides a framework for analysis by identifying pertinent influences and relationships. Ongoing and future research is needed in order to more fully understand how technology use influences learning outcomes and experiences. 

 

However, viewing technology-mediated learning from the integrated theoretical position presented above has several direct implications for educational technology research. In order to more completely understand learning in situations where technology mediates learning, we need to focus upon: 1. deeply understanding the various underlying goals of educators and students when they use technology to mediate learning; 2. understanding ways in which technological beliefs, knowledge, practices and the environment (including the sociopolitical environment) mutually influence one another with relation to educational technology usage; 3. further understanding how teachers go about learning design and what influences their design decisions; 4. understanding how the affordances of various technologies (both functional and non-functional) along with their recognition by educators and students, impact upon learning; 5. understanding how use and combination of modalities influence learning, on cognitive but also affective, connotative and kinaesthetic levels; 6. understanding how different arrangements of interactions between networks of participants mediated through technology influence learning; and 7. further understanding how presence and community can be enhanced in technologymediated learning contexts, and the impact this has on students. 

 

The learning technology research field has been criticised for being under-theorised and fragmented (Oliver, 2013), for not adequately clarifying its assumptions (Kirkwood & Price, 2013), as well as often over-relying upon “pre-digital” theories of learning (Castañeda & Selwyn, 2018). 

 

Of course, while the various components of technology-mediated learning theory presented here have been separately theorised and often empirically derived, combining them into an integrated conceptualisation, has not. The holistic theorisation of how technology mediates learning may encourage researchers and educators to adopt a more comprehensive and integrated view in their endeavours, and indeed to pressure-test the assumptions that have been proposed herein. In doing so, it encourages critical approaches to educational technology usage and research, which is ultimately seen as healthy for the field. 

 

Framing the use of technology within its sociopolitical context and noting the heterogeneity of individual beliefs and practices, also deliberately aims to encourage critical rather than deterministic approaches to educational research. It leaves entirely open the possibility that the use of technology may influence some learners in one way, other learners quite differently, and yet other learners not at all. The important point in critical approaches to educational technology research (and one that is inherent in the theorisations above) is that technology is seen to occur in a social context, and is thus influenced by the participants and environment, rather than technology being deemed to automatically have fixed effects (Selwyn, 2007). 

 

The narrative also aims to honour calls by Oliver (2013) to not assume that technologies are given or neutral, but rather need to be selected, designed and made, thus positioning technology-enhanced learning design as a site of contestation. However, the degree to which the integrated theorisation presented in this paper is used critically depends at least as much on how it is applied by researchers and educators as it does on the framework itself. To that extent, researchers and educators are encouraged to approach the use of the integrated theorisation above with ongoing reflexivity and criticality. 

 

Finally, and more broadly, the field of technology-enhanced learning has been predicated on the idea of “enhancing” learning, which is indeed a noble aspiration. But it is also ephemeral one, and does not intrinsically imply a focus on understanding what is happening when technology is being used in education. From a research perspective, it also implies that the use of technology will enhance learning, which is by no means the case, and thus constitutes an inherent bias. Actually, what we really mean, and are really interested in investigating, is the way the use of technology mediates learning. It is intended that the theoretical referents provided in this paper will enable researchers and educators to better focus upon, conceptualise and analyse technology-mediated learning from a more holistic and integrated perspective.
