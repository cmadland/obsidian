#### [Formative assessment and self‐regulated learning: a model and seven principles of good feedback practice](nicolFormativeAssessmentSelf2006.pdf)

### Abstract
The research on formative assessment and feedback is reinterpreted to show how these processes can help students take control of their own learning, i.e. become self-regulated learners. This reformulation is used to identify seven principles of good feedback practice that support self-regulation. A key argument is that students are already assessing their own work and generating their own feedback, and that higher education should build on this ability. The research underpinning each feedback principle is presented, and some examples of easy-to-implement feedback strategies are briefly described. This shift in focus, whereby students are seen as having a proactive rather than a reactive role in generating and using feedback, has profound implications for the way in which teachers organise assessments and support learning.

> [!quote] Quotable
>One of the most influential articles underpinning the Black and Wiliam review, andthe writings of other researchers (e.g. Yorke, 2003), is that of Sadler (1989). Sadleridentified  three  conditions  necessary  for  students  to  benefit  from  feedback  inacademic tasks. He argued that the student must know: 
>1. what good performance is (i.e. the student must possess a concept of the goal orstandard being aimed for);
>2. how current performance relates to good performance (for this, the student mustbe able to compare current and good performance);
>3. how to act to close the gap between current and good performance

> [!quote] Quotable
> From this analysis Sadler made an important observation: for students to be able tocompare actual performance with a standard (as suggested by 2), and take action toclose the gap (3), then they must already possess some of the same evaluative skills astheir teacher (Sadler, 1989). For some writers, this observation has led to the conclu-sion that, as well as improving the quality of feedback messages, teachers should focusmuch  more  effort  on  strengthening  the  skills  of  self-assessment  in  their  students(Boud, 2000; Yorke, 2003). Sadler’s argument, that students are already generatingtheir own feedback, also helps account for the common finding that students still makesignificant progress in their learning even when the external feedback they receive isquite impoverished (especially in many large enrolment classes)
