M3. http://doi.org/10.7203/relieve.26.1.17088 RELIEVE │2 We all have an obligation, as part of the role of the university as a public institution, to declare that our graduates have met the academic requirements of their degrees. However, we cannot assume that because it has been done in a particular way in the past, assessment continues to meet the needs of the present. We must assess in ways that do not undermine the very learning we are trying to promote; we must be conscious that anticipation of assessment has a profound effect on what and how students learn. 

 

It is wellestablished that assessment and assessment related activities have three key purposes (Boud, 2000, Boud & Soler, 2016): • To judge and certify what students have learned. That is to validate that students have met the requirements of the course. This is often termed summative assessment. • To help students learn in order to meet the requirements of the course. This often occurs through the use of various feedback processes and is termed formative assessment • To develop students’ capacity to judge their own work beyond the timescale of the course. This involves them progressively developing their own evaluative judgement, and is termed sustainable assessment. 

 

The way in which assessment is reported does not normally allow a connection between student grades and the declared learning outcomes for a course to be made. 

 

From the point of view of the individual teacher within an academic discipline, changes in assessment often appear to be so slow as to be imperceptible. However, looking at universities as a whole over several years there have been major changes, and many more can be anticipated. As universities become more influenced by external influence and regulation, the press of globalisation and the demands of students, new trends are apparent worldwide. 

 

Assessment has a legacy of discipline-based practices for which there are no wellarticulated rationales, and a set of rule-driven activities that typically are a reaction to previous problems that have been encountered. 

 

assessment methods have been introduced that, while they supposedly reduce marking, such as multiple-choice tests, they also require considerably greater investment in design and development, that is not taken into account.
