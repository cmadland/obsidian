#### [Towards a Framework to Support the Implementation of Digital Formative Assessment in Higher Education](kaya-capocciFrameworkSupportImplementation2022.pdf)




> [!tldr] Summary
> Provides theoretical justification for a 12-cell framework of digital formative assessment (four formative assessment strategies x three functions of technology) along with examples of digital tools and assessment task structures to align with those cells. No empirical testing. 

> [!cite] Bibliography

> [!quote] Quotable
> to benefit from digital formative assessment and promote its
effective implementation, we should keep in mind that the integration of technology in
formative assessment is not the goal p. 7


#### Aim of Paper
- to explain the components of the digital formative assessment framework

#### Key insights 
- good description of the fact that there are multiple factors which influence assessment practice
- authors combine self and peer assessment into one formative assessment strategy, which seems misguided
- only three 'functionalities' of technology (Sending and Displaying, Processing and Analysing, Interactive Environment)
	- this seems to be missing several key functions, or at least hiding them. e.g. curating, connecting ideas, version-control, revealing process
- no empirical data or analysis provided
- culture of assessment is important
