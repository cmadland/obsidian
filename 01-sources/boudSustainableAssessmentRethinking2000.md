Assessment involves identifying appropriate standards and criteria and making judgements about quality. 

 

Assessment therefore needs to be seen as an indispensable accompaniment to lifelong learning. 

 

This means that it has to move from the exclusive domain of assessors into the hands of learners. 

 

Sustainable assessment can similarly be de ned as assessment that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of students to meet their own future learning needs. 

 

Following further discussion of the idea of a learning society and what that implies, the paper examines some of the profound shifts in the conception and practice of assessment we are now witnessing. These shifts are all the more signi cant as they are not always visible at the level of the individual assessment act. 

 

It then suggests that a renewed focus needs to be placed on the role of formative assessment. This is needed in order to focus learners’ attention on the processes of assessment and to permit them to learn how to make these processes their own, rather than ones they are subject to. Formative assessment has been neglected as summative assessment has dominated thinking in educational institutions and in public policy debates and has taken up too high a proportion of staff time, energy and resources at the expense of preparing effective learners. It is proposed that we need to introduce high quality formative assessment practices because it is engagement with these practices which provides a secure foundation for lifelong learning and contributes directly to a learning society. Lifelong assessment is a necessary feature of lifelong learning for a learning society. It is only when we can view it in formative terms that we can avoid assessment becoming a form of incarceration.
