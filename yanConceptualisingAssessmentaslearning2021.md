*Zi Yan, David Boud*



> [!tldr] Summary
> This paper provides an updated conceptual understanding of assessment as learning including five implications for practice and contrasting assessment as learning from other learning and assessment constructs. strong connections are shown between assessment as learning  and evaluative judgement.
