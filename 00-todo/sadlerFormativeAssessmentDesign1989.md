The primary distinction between formative and summative assessment relates to purpose and effect, not to timing. It is argued below that many of the principles appropriate to summative assessment are not necessarily transferable to formative assessment; the latter requires a distinctive conceptualization and technology. 

 

An important feature of Ramaprasad's definition is that information about the gap between actual and reference levels is considered as feedback only when it is used to alter the gap. If the information is simply recorded, passed to a third party who lacks either the knowledge or the power to change the outcome, or is too deeply coded (for example, as a summary grade given by the teacher) to lead to appropriate action, the control loop cannot be closed and "dangling data" substitute for effective feedback. In any area of the curriculum where a grade or score assigned by a teacher constitutes a one-way cipher for students, attention is diverted away from fundamental judgments and the criteria for making them. A grade therefore may actually be counterproductive for formative purposes. 

 

Stated explicitly, therefore, the learner has to (a) possess a concept of the standard (or goal, or reference level) being aimed for, (b) compare the actual (or current) level of performance with the standard, and (c) engage in appropriate action which leads to some closure of the gap. These three conditions form the organizing framework for this article. It will be argued that they are necessary conditions, which must be satisfied simultaneously rather than as sequential steps. 

 

In general, a concern with the aims of summative assessment has dominated the field in terms of both research and the guidance given to teachers (Black, 1986). This dominance is implicit in the treatment given, for instance, to reliability and validity. Textbooks almost invariably describe how the validity (of assessments) is to be distinguished from the reliability (of grades or classifications). Reliability is usually (and correctly) said to be a necessary but not sufficient condition for validity, because measurements or judgments may be reliable in the sense of being consistent over time or over judges and still be off-target (or invalid). Reliability is therefore presented as a precondition for a determination of validity. In discussing formative assessment, however, the relation between reliability and validity is more appropriately stated as follows: validity is a sufficient but not necessary condition for reliability. Attention to the validity of judgments about individual pieces of work should take precedence over attention to reliability of grading in any context where the emphasis is on diagnosis and improvement. Reliability will follow as a corollary. Acceptance of this principle, which is emphasized by only a few writers (such as Nitko, 1983), has implications for how the process of appraisal is conceptualized, and the mechanisms of improvement understood.
