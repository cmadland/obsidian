#### Key insights 




#### Annotations

> anyone interested in contemporary education needs to be mindful of the complex relationships that have developed between education and technology. these are aspects of education that demand sustained analysis and critical thought. This is *not* simply a background feature or narrow technical concern . p.2

> Any discussion of education and technology needs to be wide-ranging and broad-minded. In particular, our principle focus should not be on technological devices, tools, and applications, per se, but the practices and activities that surround them, the meanings that people attach to them, and the social relations and structures that these technologies are linked to. p.2

### Education as #process v #product (Säljö) p. 4

 > 1. quantitative increase in knowledge - acquiring information - knowing a lot
 > 2. memorising - storing information so that it can be reproduced
 > 3. acquiring facts, skills, and mthods that can be retained and used as necessary
 
 Contrast with learning as process
> 4. learning as making sense and abstracting meaning - learning that involves relating parts of the subject matter to each other and to the (real) world.
> 5. learning as interpreting and understanding reality in a different way, that is, learning that involves comprehending the world by reinterpreting knowledge

Gert Biesta - 3 broad functions of education
1. qualification - giving people knowledge, skills, and dispositions that allow them to do something
2. socialization - inserting individuals into existing ways of doing and being (particular social, cultural, and political orders)
3. subjectification - giving individuals a sense of who they are, encouraging the ability to act autonomously, and think independently and critically p. 6
Much of what happens in education has nothing to do with learning, but instead in the 'social milieu' of education p. 6

### Technology
p.7

- distinguishing between 'technical' and 'social' in education also carries over to technology
- technology is a "designed, material means to an end" (Agar, 2020, p. 381)
	- diff between tree canopy and an umbrella providing shelter from rain

p. 8
- technology is something that is 'developed and applied so that we can do thiengs not otherwise possible, or so that we can do them cheaper, faster, and easier' (Volti, 1992, p. 4)
- all technologies have the essential property of 'intervening between scales' (Agar, 2020)
	- cars help us move from 'body-scale' distances to 'road-scale' distances; refrigerators expand thermodynamic scales

p. 9
> the term technology has always referred to the processes and practices of doing things, understanding things, and developing knowledge. p. 9

- contemporary uses of the term technology refers to more than just machinery, but also social contexts and circumstances of the use of the machine
- technologies are cultural objects
	- internet is far more than just wires, cables, connections, servers, and nodes; people talk about activities they engage in online, the cultures and values that surround these activities and the knowledge that results from these activities

p.10
Conceptualizing the social and technical aspects of technology - Lievrouw and Livingstone, 2002
- **Artefacts and devices** - the technology itself and how it is designed and made
- **Activities and practices** - what people do with technology (including human interaction, organization, identity, techniques and competencies)
- **Context** - social arrangements and organizational forms that surround the use of technologies (including institutions, social structures, cultures, and beliefs)
