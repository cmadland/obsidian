Although it can be argued that the central purpose of educational assessment should be to support learning, in practice, assessment is often more focused on qualifications and the reporting of achievement. The growing importance in many countries of so-called ‘high-stakes’ assessment in recent years as a policy tool to encourage greater competition and accountability between schools and across the education system as a whole, has greatly increased this focus on periodic, summative judgments of student performance in terms of overall grades and percentages. 

 

In a world increasingly transformed by technology in the way people communicate, do business and live their daily lives, schools, colleges and universities have been slow to adapt to such changes, particularly in assessment modes and practices (Shute et al, 2010). 

 

The aim of this paper is to discuss the potential, the challenges and the risks associated with what might be termed technology enhanced assessment (TEA) and its possible role in rethinking the purposes of assessment in relation to student learning. It is predicated on the view that there is a need to better understand how digital technologies can be used to support and transform assessment and learning. 

 

Although this evolution of terminology suggests that understanding of the potential uses of technology in assessment has become broader over time, such terms do not suggest any fundamental transformation of the scope of assessment through the use of technology. 

 

We define TEA to include any use of digital technologies for the purposes of enhancing formal or informal educational assessment for both formative and summative purposes. 

 

The Review was structured around three key questions: • What do digital technologies offer for educational assessment? • How might assessment be different when knowledge and performance can be represented digitally? • Where is the 'cutting edge' in such developments at present? 

 

'Innovative' or 'cutting edge' practices were defined as those, which provide new insights or practices to the field of TEA, particularly those that appear to offer the possibility of genuinely new modes or models of assessment. 

 

There are many critiques of current assessment policies and practices. These include their misalignment to curriculum priorities, an over-reliance on grading and negative impacts on students’ confidence and learning aspirations (Schwartz and Arena, 2009; Attwood and Radnofsky, 2007; Broadfoot, 2007; Gee and Shaffer, 2010; Shute & Kim, 2013; Deneen & Boud, 2014). Such arguments are also backed by growing research evidence about what constitutes effective feedback in both schools and university contexts and a recognition that conventional methods of assessment, tried and tested as they have been over more than a century, are increasingly unfit for purpose (Hattie &. Timperley, 2007, Nicol & McFarlaneDick, 2006; Boud & Molloy, 2013). 

 

The world is changing rapidly and with it, the knowledge and skills - even the dispositions and attitudes - that educational systems need to deliver. Whilst previously the focus of education could be predominantly on the inculcation of an existing canon of knowledge, now it must reflect new priorities. The imperative to develop education systems that prepare students for the future is increasingly being pressed in political, business and educational 

 

discourses (Claxton, 2009) and through the notion of the 'knowledge economy' that associates national and global economic success with investing in education and the increase of 'skills' (Facer, 2012). Creativity, problem-solving, adaptability, resilience, resourcefulness, even spiritual and moral ‘literacies’, are found in the curriculum aspirations of countries and organisations across the world where such competencies are seen to be essential for success in future society3. 

 

We argue that there needs to be a re-evaluation of both the purposes and processes of assessment that will in turn prompt the development of new assessment methods, leading to assessment that is more meaningful and more educationally and culturally relevant for learners and teachers. 

 

Despite the belief that the use of technology for assessment could become a major agent for change within the education system (Mansell, 2009) and a growing recognition of the potential of technology in this respect, the implementation of genuinely innovative assessment practices using technological affordances appears to remain narrow in scope (Mogey, 2011; Whitelock and Watt, 2008, Beevers, 2011). 

 

Critiques in the literature suggest (as with assessment more broadly, see James, 2014) an over emphasis on technology for efficiency and the potential for standardising, grading and recording data. This appears to be limiting the development of more imaginative and creative possibilities. Where innovation is taking place, this is often in isolated pockets or subject to funding constraints on continuation and sustainability. Furthermore, policy discussions and decisions on assessment can contribute to an over simplified view of technology as a ‘quick fix’ or a means of replicating existing methods rather than seeing its potential to challenge and re-model existing practices and re-imagine the purpose of assessment and its relationship to learning (Shute & Kim, 2013; Thornton, 2012). 

 

Rather than taking a technologically-determinist perspective as discussed above, a number o 

 

17 scholars have stressed the need to look at any particular innovation in terms of the unique cultural, social and institutional context which will influence its use and outcomes (Jenkins et al, 2006; Zhao and Frank, 2003; James 2014). 

 

Others argue for novel assessment practices to be based upon an understanding of the principles and theories that underpin learning, particularly the role of feedback in assessment, in conjunction with robust and valid research (Draper 2009a; Draper 2009b; Boud & Molloy, 2013; Hattie & Brown, 2008). Such authors argue that innovations should be based on a 'pedagogically driven model’ that ‘can allow students to take more control of their own learning and become more reflective' (Whitelock and Watt, 2008: 152), as opposed to new forms of assessment being driven by the possibilities of the technology itself. 

 

Although it can be argued that the central purpose of educational assessment should be to support learning, in practice, assessment is often more focused on qualifications and the reporting of achievement. The growing importance in many countries of so-called ‘high-stakes’ assessment in recent years as a policy tool to encourage greater competition and accountability between schools and across the education system as a whole, has greatly increased this focus on periodic, summative judgments of student performance in terms of overall grades and percentages.
