#### [Are we answering the question that has been set? Exploring the gap between research and practice around examinations in higher education](buckleyAreWeAnswering2023.pdf)




> [!tldr] Summary
> Buckley provides a thorough review of the literature in relation to how assessment research, specifically related to high-security, in-person exams, often fails to address assessment practitioners' actual needs and constraints. 

> [!cite] Bibliography
>Buckley, A. (2023). Are we answering the question that has been set? Exploring the gap between research and practice around examinations in higher education. _Studies in Higher Education_, 1–17. [https://doi.org/10.1080/03075079.2023.2283784](https://doi.org/10.1080/03075079.2023.2283784)

> [!quote] Quotable
> The issue of exams is a promising case study for the gap between research and practice in assessment in higher education, simply because the gap appears so large. The widespread and ongoing use of traditional exams seems to stubbornly ignore the volume of negative literature. By focusing on exams, this article attempts to shed some wider light on how the research-practice gap in assessment in higher education can be made at least a little narrower. p.4
