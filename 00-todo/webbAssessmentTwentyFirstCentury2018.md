In many countries, in recent years, a renewed focus on assessments to support learning has been pushing against the burgeoning of testing for accountability (Black 2015; Shute et al. 2016), which, in some countries, renders effective formative assessment practices almost impossible (Black 2015). Furthermore a strong focus on summative assessment for accountability can reduce motivation and disengage many learners (Harlen and Deakin Crick 2002). 

 

Thus, while much effort in institutional and national testing systems is focused on harnessing the power of automated systems in order to reduce costs and increase efficiency (Bennett 2015), a range of different assessment scenarios have been the focus of research and development, often at small scale (Stödberg 2012), for some years. 

 

One perspective is of the formative process – learning from the feedback information provided by an assessment process. Another perspective focuses on the results, which may be evident, for example, in revised lesson plans or in targets set by students for themselves, of adaptations made to instruction based on an interpretation of the 

 

evidence from the assessment. The third is the understanding of the assessment and the degree of engagement by students and teachers in the assessment process. The fourth is the value judgment of results which provides summative information based on the evidence. Perspectives 1 and 3 in Table 1 are crucial for assessment to be formative and can be either short-term learning processes involving “interactive regulation” during the vast numbers of minute-to-minute interactions in classrooms (Perrenoud 1998)orin longer-term processes involved in planning lessons, designing activities, and setting targets (Perspective 2). Perspectives 3 and 4 are essential for summative assessment. Perspective 3 is important for both formative and summative assessment because unless students engage with the process of assessment, the information generated will not be valid. Furthermore, if the students fail to engage with the feedback information, there will be no effect on their learning. Perspective 4, in particular, is where there may be significant conflicts between the formative and summative assessment purposes. Making value judgments may be important at key transition points for the purposes of grading, accreditation, setting, etc., but such processes impact on students’ engagement with learning (Harlen and Deakin Crick 2002) as discussed later in this chapter. 

 

Therefore, feedback becomes part of a communication process between learners and between learners and the teacher thus placing emphasis on interaction 

 

At the same time, development of the theoretical basis of self-regulated learning has moved toward increasing focus on co-regulation, socially shared regulation, and the importance of peer interaction (Chan 2012; Järvelä and Hadwin 2013)as discussed later in this chapter. 

 

For example, a study of 50 fourth-grade students revealed a significant relationship between the students’ levels of test anxiety, as measured by pulse rate, and performance on the New York State Standardized Science Test (Fulton 2016). 

 

Harlen and Deakin Crick’s systematic review (Harlen and Deakin Crick 2002) revealed that high-stakes tests can result in changes to teaching to a transmission style that only caters for a limited range of students. Furthermore, a strong emphasis on testing produces students who are extrinsically oriented toward grades and social status rather than being oriented toward learning (ibid.). 

 

More recently Black built on Perrenoud’s ideas and proposed a more comprehensive model of assessment in pedagogical practices (Black 2012, 2015) consisting of five stages with clear links between them and all involving assessment: 1. Clear aims: The first stage of planning 2. Planning activities: Setting up activities with the potential to achieve the aims 3. Implementation in the classroom 4. Review of the learning: Using informal assessments to check achievement 5. Summing up: Using assessment to guide decisions about the next stage of students’ work 

 

on collaborative learning places more emphasis on co-regulation or socially shared regulation of learning in which multiple group members regulate their joint activity in order to achieve a shared goal (Hadwin et al. 2010; Jarvela et al. 2008).

In order to achieve the learning benefits that should accrue from IT-enabled assessments, teachers and students will need to be engaged not only in the production of new tools that visualize the information (e.g., to help shape how the new tools provide the most useful and understandable information) but also in the dynamic creation of meaning from the use of those tools in learning situations (e.g., to create personal insights from the experiences as well as the reflections made possible by the new tools (Webb and Gibson 2015).
