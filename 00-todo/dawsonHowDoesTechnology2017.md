Stödberg’s (2012) structured review of the literature indicates that the typical technology-supported assessment study is small scale, short term and focused on a multiple-choice intervention. When compared with ‘state-of-the-art’ approaches, like high-fidelity simulation or intelligent tutoring systems, it could be easy to get disheartened by the slow progress towards technology enablement of assessment for learning at scale. 

 

First, technology-enabled AfL interventions need to be guided by clear goals. 

 

Secondly, technology-enabled AfL interventions should pay attention to relational and contextual matters. Assessment change is hard enough; when the additional conceptual shift towards AfL is added, it becomes more challenging, and when technology is introduced, the problem becomes more challenging still. 

 

Thirdly, educators and institutions need to invest in improvements to assessment design. Key meta-analyses of educational technology (Means et al., 2010; Russell, 2013) concur that adding technology to an existing design and expecting improvements is a flawed approach.
