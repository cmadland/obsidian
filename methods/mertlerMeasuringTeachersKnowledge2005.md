#### Aim of Paper

The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to develop an instrument that could accurately measure teachers’ assessment literacy, and (2) to determine the psychometric qualities of this instrument.  The research questions addressed in the study were: Research Question 1: What are the psychometric properties of the Assessment Literacy Inventory (ALI) when used with preservice teachers? Research Question 2: Could the ALI serve as a useful instrument for evaluating preservice competency in classroom assessment?

#### Key insights 

- assessment is critically important for learning
- at the time of writing, too few k12 teachers received enough training in assessment
- formal training in assessment is the best way to improve assessment practice
- improved assessment practice improves learning (.75 standard deviations on standardized tests)
