Thus, it is preferable when explanation plus prediction are the main objectives in the structural model ( Shmueli et al., 2019 ). • Measurement model types. PLS-SEM easily handles formative constructs (referred to as composite)–constructs with arrows point- ing from the observable variables without posing specific constraints on the model.
