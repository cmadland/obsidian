Classroom assessment has become a cornerstone in today’s standards-based systems of education (Brookhart, 2011; Popham, 2013; Stobart, 2008). 

 

Given these emerging benefits and coupled with the foregoing policy developments, there has been increased attention on supporting teachers’ assessment literacy – teachers’ ability to negotiate and articulate classroom and cultural contexts in order to initiate, develop, practise, integrate, and use appropriate assessment approaches to promote student 

 

learning towards educational standards (Willis, Adie, & Klenowski, 2013). However, despite repeated calls for enhanced teacher assessment literacy (Popham, 2013), research has continually demonstrated that teachers face significant challenges integrating new approaches to assessment that align with contemporary mandates and assessment theories (Bennett, 2011; DeLuca & Klinger, 2010; Maclellan, 2004). As a result, teachers maintain variable understandings about educational assessment leading to fundamentally different orientations and classroom practices. Researchers have also noted that there is comparatively little reliable data on teachers’ current approaches to assessment in relation to existing accountability demands due to a lack of contemporary assessment literacy measures (DeLuca, LaPointeMcEwen, & Luhanga, 2016b; Gotch & French, 2014). 

 

The majority of quantitative research conducted on teachers’ approaches to assessment has used assessment literacy measures predicated on professional standards from the early 1990s (i.e. Standard for Teacher Competency in Educational Assessment of Students, American Federation of Teachers, National Council on Measurement in Education, & National Education Association, 1990) (DeLuca et al., 2016b; Gotch & French, 2014). While these standards have significantly and positively shaped assessment research, they were developed prior to the accountability and standards-based movement and therefore do not fully measure teachers’ approaches to assessment in relation to the current context of classroom assessment (Brookhart, 2011; DeLuca et al., 2016b; Gotch & French, 2014). 

 

Specifically, Brookhart (2011) noted that the 1990 Standards (AFT, NCME & NEA, 1990) have become dated in two notable ways: (a) they do not consider current conceptions of formative assessment (i.e. assessment for and as learning), and (b) they do not consider the social issues and diverse contexts teachers face in constructing and using assessments within standards-based educational reforms. The recently published Classroom Assessment Standards (Joint Committee for Standards on Educational Evaluation, 2015) addresses these critiques by articulating a new set of research-based principles and guidelines for assessing student learning in relation to the current landscape of educational assessment. 

 

The development of the new standards (JCSEE, 2015) coupled with evolving demands in classroom assessment suggests that previous assessment literacy measures may not yield strong validity in relation to current teaching contexts (DeLuca et al., 2016b; Gotch & French, 2014). Hence, the purpose of this paper was to use a new assessment literacy measure (predicated on the Classroom Assessment Standards) to analyse teachers’ current approaches to classroom assessment. In particular, this research aimed to analyse classroom teachers’ differential responses to contemporary assessment scenarios and explore their perceived skill related to specific assessment responsibilities relevant to accountability and standards-based frameworks of education.

Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to determine factor structures and subscales for Part Two and Part Three of the ACAI. 

 

KMO measures 

 

Pearson’s chi-square tests and ANOVAs were conducted. 

 

The ANOVAs were conducted on subscale means created by adding up (averaging) scores on only those items identified by the factor analysis.

contingency tables (cross-tabs) 

 

If significance was found within a 3 × 3 or 2 × 3 contingency table, post hoc chisquare tests were then conducted on all 2 × 2 combinations from that table to determine specifically where the significant associations existed. 

 

Specifically, this research aimed to analyse teachers’: (a) approaches to classroom assessment scenarios, (b) perceived skill in assessment tasks and responsibilities and (c) professional learning preferences and priorities, based on their career stage, teaching division, and previous assessment education. 

 

One significant difference was observed based on teachers’ career experience. Specifically, teachers’ approaches to Assessment Fairness became more differentiated with increased years of teaching experience. 

 

Early career teachers tend towards a standardised approach with mid-career teachers tending to employ an equitable approach. The most experienced teachers in this sample generally favoured a differentiated approach. 

 

Specifically, this finding highlights that teachers hold relatively established assessment orientations that may be difficult to change once in-service. 

 

Accordingly, assessment education at the pre-service level must provide teacher candidates with a strong foundation in contemporary assessment standards and practices. 

 

Interestingly, teachers with no courses in assessment reported a higher level of skill in assessment than those with previous assessment education, although this difference was only significant for the Monitoring, Analysing, and Communicating factor. While this finding may seem counter-intuitive, we argue that assessment education courses help teachers begin to develop awareness and deeper understanding of the complexities associated with contemporary conceptions of assessment literacy. Becoming aware of these complexities may actually negatively impact teachers’ self-reported skill in assessment literacies when compared to teachers who do not have previous assessment education experiences and may not yet have this awareness (DeLuca & Klinger, 2010; Volante & Fazio, 2007). 

 

Second, this instrument is a self-report measure. 

 

Future research should advance the use of the instrument to measure within school consistencies through teacher observations and assessment samples to enable discussions about priorities and challenges of enacted assessment practices.
