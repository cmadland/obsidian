> [!tldr] Summary
> Assessment and feedback are inseparable components of learning. When there is too much emphasis on one-way transmission of feedback from instructor to learner as opposed to dialogic approaches, imbalances between the purposes of assessment and feedback can occur.

Whilst both assessment and feedback have important and legitimate roles in university courses, they do not have the same function. However, the ways in which they have become entangled in policy and practice have resulted in a conceptual and practical blurring of their unique purposes. In this paper, we present a critical examination of issues created by the entanglement of assessment and feedback, arguing that it is important to ensure that the legitimate purposes of both feedback and assessment are not compromised by inappropriate conflation of the two. 

 

Assessment is primarily seen as serving an evaluation and certification function. Whilst the process of undertaking a task can be a valuable learning opportunity in itself (e.g. Boud and Soler 2016), assessment commonly focuses on summative evaluation of student performance against appropriate standards or criteria, in order to generate grades which are reliable, valid, and defensible. On the other hand, the primary function of feedback is to influence students’ future work and learning strategies. Thus, within the same act of grading work and providing comments, the marker is enacting two very different purposes: grade award and justification (considering past achievement) and the provision of feedback information (to influence future achievement). 

 

Currently, we suggest, assessment often ‘strangles’ the learning function of feedback. We need to reposition feedback as more than an afterthought, to something that is meaningful in its own right, not just something that happens alongside assessment. 

 

The overlapping and sometimes contested functions of formative and summative assessment are described by Cookson (2018, 930) as a ‘conceptual mêlée’, reflecting the lack of clarity over nomenclature. Similarly, Rand (2017) argues that the dichotomy between formative and summative functions of assessment is a simplistic one, whilst Black (1998, 34) states that ‘the two functions are two ends of the same spectrum’. Sadler (1989) argued against the same assessment task serving both a formative and summative purpose, for the reason that the grade or mark (a summative evaluation) might obscure students’ attention to the formative purpose of feedback information. 

 

Taking this argument further, Rust (2000) advocated removing summative assessment from modules; instead, he proposed that modulebased learning should be purely formative in function, with summative assessment taking place at a programmatic level. 

 

For the purposes of this paper, we define feedback as ‘processes where the learner makes sense of performance-relevant information to promote their learning’ (Henderson et al. 2019a, 15). In this sense, feedback is not about grade justification but forward-looking information that helps students further develop their work. 

 

Increasingly evident in the literature is an appreciation that moving beyond this impasse requires a conceptual and practical reframing of feedback away from a process driven by teachers, towards a learning-focused process where students are active players in feedback processes who work with and apply information from others to future learning tasks (e.g., Boud and Molloy 2013; Price et al. 2011). 

 

However, the entanglement of assessment and feedback can impede this shift towards learning-focused feedback processes. In particular, a learning-focused approach requires feedback processes to come to the fore within assessment regimes, while the dominant assessment and feedback culture in current practice runs counter to this approach (Winstone and Carless 2019). 

 

Students focus on grades rather than developmental information I do all this writing, they don’t read it, they just look at the number, so why am I wasting my time? (Senior Leader Interview, Arts) 

 

Teachers focus comments on justifying the grade rather than providing developmental information While [feedback] should be about helping students maximise their learning experience, these days it is a kind of backside-covering exercise to avoid student complaints - lecturers have to justify their mark to avoid a challenge rather than focussing on student learning. (Survey response, definition of feedback) 

 

Feedback information can come too late to be of use [Feedback] should allow students to reflect on their work and use this to feed forward to the next assessment. However this can be difficult in a modular degree. (Survey response, definition of feedback) 

 

Feedback is not a focus in course design It would be nice to be able to specifically design follow up assessment tasks to allow students to enact the feedback comments they receive in prior tasks, but for administrative/audit purposes, our institution very tightly constrains the way in which we assess. (Survey response, what makes effective feedback) 

 

Forms of documenting feedback can impair its quality [Academics] talk ... very positively about the actual work, even just in the critique of the work, ‘it was okay, but this needs...’ and it’s full of passion and drive. That all disappears when it comes to sitting at the computer and writing up the report. And then it becomes, you know... for want of a better phrase, ‘these bloody reports’! (Senior Leader Interview, Arts) 

 

Anonymous grading depersonalises and inhibits the quality of feedback Work is marked anonymously, so how can the comments be made personal to a given individual? (Survey response, what makes effective feedback) 

 

Adaptive release of grades Where grades can distract students from engagement with potentially useful feedback information, then withholding grades until students have engaged with feedback information, sometimes called ‘adaptive release of grades’, is a potential solution (e.g. Parkin et al. 2012). 

 

Student elicitation of feedback information Students’ attention to feedback information rather than grades might be promoted by positioning students as initiators of a feedback dialogue in which they have declared a stake, rather than as recipients of unsolicited information. 

 

Designing for implementing feedback information Any intermediate assessment task should be regarded not as a discrete activity undertaken at a particular point of time, but as part of a necessary ongoing learning process which involves students acting in anticipation of the task, during the task and following receipt of information about their performance of the task. 

 

Reallocating time spent on providing detailed comments to a different part of the learning cycle It is common for a large part of the time devoted by teachers to feedback activities to be delivered at the times of the year when students are least receptive to it and have the least opportunities to act on it. 

 

Depending on the specific requirements of individual disciplines, it may be possible to decouple feedback from grading by providing detailed comments on work-inprogress, and giving students the opportunity to apply them to a final graded task. Students are enabled to implement comments, and the time of academic staff would be used to greater effect. 

 

Separate anonymous grading from personalised feedback It could be argued that the negative impact of anonymous grading on the learning potential of feedback occurs purely because assessment and feedback are entangled. 

 

Foster ongoing curation of feedback Greater emphasis on the developmental function of feedback can be achieved through systems that support the collation and synthesis of feedback, such as a feedback portfolio (Clarke and Boud 2018; Winstone 2019). For students, this enables them to track their development in relation to prior feedback information, and identify what they need to address in future work. For tutors, this enables them to build on and not simply repeat comments which have not been acted upon. 

 

Disentanglement: Implications for research and practice 

 

In terms of practice, disentanglement requires feedback to be designed into courses, rather than focusing on assessment designs alone where the feedback function may be compromised from the start. 

 

Disentangling the functions of assessment and feedback also requires acknowledgment that only limited progress can be made by focusing on individual course units. A programmatic view needs to be taken of both assessment and feedback.
