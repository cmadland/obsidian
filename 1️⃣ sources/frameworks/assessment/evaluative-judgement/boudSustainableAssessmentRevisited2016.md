We should note though that while assessment design is of great importance, the strictures of Lindberg-Sand and Olsson (2008) should also be taken into account. How students respond to learning opportunities and assessment tasks is not just a feature of the activities themselves, which can be carefully designed. They depend also on the ways in which they are perceived and the ways students take them up, which cannot be controlled in advance. While many features of teaching, learning and assessment can be designed, there are also emergent practices independent of the dynamics of the context and players involved that can never be fully determined.
