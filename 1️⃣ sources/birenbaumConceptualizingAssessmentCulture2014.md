The past two decades have witnessed promising developments in student assessment in line with social constructivist approaches to learning and cognition (Vygotsky 1978; Brown et al. 1989). First, alternative assessment (AA) was introduced and later, assessment for learning (AfL), both reflecting a shift from a quantitative, mechanistic approach to a qualitative, holistic one that focuses on learning, acknowledges the social context of the assessment and aims to promote self-regulated learning (Assessment Reform Group 2002; Birenbaum 1996; Black and Wiliam 1998). However, both approaches failed to fulfill their potential due to inappropriate implementations. 

 

Recent evaluations of AfL implementations in various countries point to its misinterpretation as implying excessive testing (Klenowski 2009); its being overshadowed by ‘assessment as learning’(Hume and Coll 2009; Torrance 2007); and being enacted in ways that conform only to its ‘letter’ rather than embracing its ‘spirit’ (Marshall and Drummond 2006). 

 

This chapter focuses on the context in which AfL is enacted. That is, the school’s culture which, when examined through an assessment lens, varies from a gradingoriented, testing culture to a learning-oriented, assessment culture. 

 

Assessment culture (AC) is at the center of the discussion, in which I adopt a complex-systems framework to explain the nature of such a culture and its reciprocal connections with two interrelated learning systems that are nested within it, namely, classroom learning and teacher professional learning. 

 

A complex system, such as an organization, is an open, organic, and dynamic system that constantly evolves (that is, is far from equilibrium). Changes in the system occur as a result of interactions among agents (people or ideas), who self-organize with no directives from authority (that is, bottom up). From the mass of interactions, regularities are formed from which patterns emerge, which in turn transmit feedback to the interactions. In such a way, the system evolves; the more interactions among agents, the more likely the emergence of new patterns, implying that complex organizations are likely to experience renewal. 

 

Complex systems, unlike complicated systems, are systems for which the adage that the whole is greater than the sum of its components, applies. Since it is impossible to predict with certainty the nature of the patterns that will emerge, it is inappropriate to apply the linear logic of cause and effect to such systems (hence the reference to non-linearity with regard to complex systems). 

 

Complex systems are often nested inside other systems with which they share similar properties. Through their recursive interactions, agents (or systems) influence one another in a co-evolutionary process. A complex school system thus comprises several nested complex systems, such as the student, the teacher, classroom learning, teacher professional learning, AC, etc. 

 

Classroom learning has been conceptualized from a complexity perspective, acknowledging the social nature of learning and addressing the main features of such systems, namely self-organization and emergence, as well as the synergetic view that the whole is larger than the sum of its components. 

 

For instance, Barab and his colleagues (Barab et al. 1999) advanced a self-organization model of classroom learning predicated on a relational ontology. According to their view, ‘knowing, meaning, and cognition are actualized through the dynamic between learner ...and environment ...and that which is neither the learner nor the environment’ (p. 350). 

 

Newell (2008), too, conceptualized learning as an emergent behavior from dynamic local interactions between teacher and students which, as such, transcends that of the individuals within the class. However, Newell’s conceptualization of emergent learning centered on the interplay or dynamic balancing of tension between opposites. 

 

Newell (2008), too, conceptualized learning as an emergent behavior from dynamic local interactions between teacher and students which, as such, transcends that of the individuals within the class. However, Newell’s conceptualization of emergent learning centered on the interplay or dynamic balancing of tension between opposites. Building on notions advanced by Davis and Sumara (2006), he listed necessary but insufficient conditions for emergent learning, which include: specialization—redundancy (common understandings and language) and internal diversity; trans-level learning—decentralized control and neighbor interactions between ideas that may lead to self-organization of the class’s knowledge; and enabling constraints—organized randomness (that is, maintaining ‘a delicate balance between sufficient organization to orient agents’actions and sufficient randomness to allow for varied and flexible response’ (Davis and Simmt 2003, p. 141)). Newell further contended that the emergence of learning in the class could be facilitated (‘occasioned’) by tasks that act as ‘enabling constraints’. 

 

A recent definition of AfL states that ‘[it] is part of everyday practice by students, teachers, and peers that seeks, reflects upon and responds to information from dialogue, demonstration, and observation in ways that enhance ongoing learning’ (AFL 2009). 

 

Contemporary writings about assessment conceptualize it as inquiry (Calfee and Masuda 1997; Delandshere 2002); indeed, an optimal AfL cycle corresponds to an inquiry cycle (Birenbaum et al. 2009). An AfL cycle consists of six phases: planning (setting goals, defining objectives); designing tools to elicit learners’ understanding; collecting evidence (including providing accommodations when needed); interpreting (estimating the gaps between intended and obtained outcomes and generating feedback to the learners and the teacher); utilizing (taking measures, where needed, to close the gaps); and evaluating (assessing the effectiveness of those measures in closing the gaps) (Birenbaum 2009; Birenbaum et al. 2009). For AfL cycles to be implemented successfully, the learning environment ought to offer supportive mechanisms and cultivate conducive norms, values, and beliefs (Birenbaum et al. 2009, 2011). 

 

Research has shown that the most effective professional development for in-service teachers is situated in their school context and builds on their knowledge and dayto-day classroom challenges. Participants in a school-based professional learning community (SBPLC) collaboratively develop an inquiry stance toward their own practice (Cochran-Smith and Lytle 1999). 

 

A high level SBPLC is characterized by a focus on student learning, shared school vision, reflective dialogues, collaboration, shared responsibility coupled with high expectations for the learning of all students in the school, professional self-efficacy, and collective efficacy, and supportive social climate. Marked are norms of transparency, ‘deprivatizating’ of practice (that is, opening one’s practice to scrutiny), legitimizing errors and common language (McLaughlin and Talbert 2006; Vescio et al. 2008). The inquiry process into their practice follows a cycle corresponding to the AfL cycle (Birenbaum et al. 2009) and is supported by learning mechanisms for evaluation, knowledge management, staff involvement, and professional development. 

 

Opfer and Pedder (2011) recently advanced a conceptualization of teacher professional learning from a complexity perspective, viewing it as a complex system rather than an event. They underscored three interdependent and reciprocally influential complex subsystems the teacher, the school, and the learning activity whose recursive interactions, so they claimed, result in the emergence of teacher professional learning. Acknowledging that such learning is contextually situated, Opfer and Pedder maintained that their conceptualization shifted the focus from the cause-andeffect (linear) logic that has dominated teacher professional development literature, a logic that has limited explanatory ability, to a non-linear logic that focuses on causal explanations which enable us to understand under what conditions, why and how teachers learn. 

 

As contended by Morris and colleagues (2014: 1), ‘in order to understand, discuss, and measure culture it must be recognized as a complex, multi-dimensional, and multi-agent system’ (p. 13). 

 

The complexivist conceptualization of organizational culture applies to AC as well. It emerges from the multiplicity of the interactions among agents within and between the two learning systems and, in turn, strengthens the connections between the agents, resulting in more learning interactions, thus increasing the complexity of the systems. Reflected in the AC is a set of beliefs that will be referred to the ‘AC mindset’. 

 

AC mindset draws on two other mindsets: a complexivist mindset (Davis and Sumara 2010; Morrison 2008) and a growth mindset (Dweck 2006). 

 

A complexivist mindset can be characterized according to the following indicators: awareness of limitations, positive uncertainty (Helsing 2007), inquisitive orientation; ‘enabling constraints’ (Davis and Sumara 2010); and valued diversity. 

 

A growth mindset, according to Dweck (2006), is an implicit theory regarding one’s basic qualities, such as personality, intellectual abilities, etc., being malleable or incremental, rather than fixed, ‘carved in stone’, or innate. An implicit theory regarding basic qualities can be the shared belief of members of an organization (Murphy and Dweck 2010). 

 

Holders of AC mindset value learning and believe that deep learning is the goal rather than ‘making the grade’. 

 

Such beliefs are in line with constructivist epistemological beliefs about knowledge and knowing (Hofer and Pintrich 1997) and social constructivist approaches to knowledge and cognition (Vygotsky 1978; Brown et al. 1989). 

 

Holders of an AC mindset believe that assessment should facilitate (rather than track) learning, and inform instruction: 

 

Moreover, they believe that assessment is a continuous, dynamic process: 

 

They also believe that inquisitive disposition is the key to improvement (in line with beliefs of a complexivist mindset): 

 

Holders of an AC mindset believe that assessment should take the form of a dialogue with the learner, as the origin of the word ‘assessment’ implies (assid  ̄ ere, in Latin means ‘sit by’) 

 

They also attribute much importance to collaborative assessment: 

 

Holders of an AC mindset believe that self-regulated learning can be facilitated through assessment (for example, through inquiry tasks, reflection, feedback, etc.), a belief that is rooted in an emancipatory stance of education (Habermas 1971; Freire 1987): 

 

Moreover, teachers and students who hold such a mindset seem eager to get feedback: 

 

Holders of an AC mindset value diversity; they believe that multiple perspectives and solutions are desired (in line with beliefs of a complexivist mindset). 

 

Moreover, holders of this mindset believe that a positive attitude toward uncertainty should be developed, which will lead to creativity (that is, ‘exploration of the space of possibilities’, in line with beliefs of a complexivist mindset): 

 

In such schools, the teachers’ assessment practice of catering to the needs of each student reflects their belief that in assessment, like in other areas in life, ‘one size does not fit all’ 

 

In line with beliefs of a growth mindset, in schools holding an AC mindset, individual and collective self-efficacy (Bandura 1982) beliefs are manifested: 

 

In line with beliefs of a complexivist mindset, holders of this mindset believe that given the complexity of learning and the inferential nature of assessment, modesty on the part of the assessor is essential, hence consulting the performer or colleagues is needed in order to validate the inferences 

 

Moreover, when faced with unexpected performance they try to explain it, for example by questioning the validity of the assessment 

 

To summarize, the set of beliefs that characterize an AC mindset seem to correspond to underlying beliefs associated with high-quality implementations of AfL; an AC mindset can thus be referred to as AfL mindset. The complexivist and growth mindsets that are intertwined with it seem to cast new light on main AfL principles. Reflecting such a mindset, the AC can be characterized as a culture of inquiry to facilitate learning. 

 

Adopting a complexity framework, it conceptualizes AC as a complex system in which two complex learning systems are nested. Through recursive interactions, the systems influence each other in a co-evolutionary process, resulting in emergence of new knowledge and paradigms. In line with complexity conceptualizations of organizational culture, the effects of AC are marked, and the mindset it reflects is underscored. Further, this mindset represents the ‘spirit’ that is claimed to be missing from many current implementations of AfL practice that are taking place in schools characterized by a TC, reflecting an assessment for grading (AfG) mindset. (A mindset that builds on a mechanistic mindset (Hoogervorst 2009)andafixed mindset (Dweck 2006)). 

 

Therefore, I conclude that the prevailing low-quality of AfL practices can be attributed to a mismatch between assessment practice and assessment mindset. 

 

As for researching an AC, in accordance with recommendations for investigating complex organizations in general and their culture in particular, a descriptive or explanatory study rather than a prescriptive or predictive one (Radford 2008), preferably conducted as a participatory inquiry (Steel 2002), seems an appropriate choice. Special attention should be given to perspectives of the interacting agents, to their conceptions, beliefs, orientations, and dispositions, preferably elicited in reference to artefacts that were the objects of the interactions or their outcomes (for example, assessment tasks, student performances, teacher feedback, peer feedback, 

 

self-assessment, planning documents, rubrics, etc.). Further, an AC inquiry should explore the reciprocal connections between the AC and the two learning systems, and trace their co-evolution. Furthermore, exploring patterns as they emerge, the researcher should try to distinguish between patterns that are highly contextual and those that are more generalizable (Davis and Sumara 2010). Finally, in order to be attentive to the intricate and often paradoxical nature of the systems under study, it is desirable that the researcher adopts a complexivist mindset.
